<h2>More About Me</h2>
<details>
  <summary>My Childhood</summary>
<p>I was the quintessential "Air Force brat".  My father was active duty for 28 years, my mother worked for the Air Force in Civil Service for 30 years, my husband was active duty for 25 years and worked for the Air Force in Civil Service for 22 years.  My uncle was active duty for 30 years and my little brother even did a 4-year enlistment as well.  I have been connected with the Air Force all my life and have no idea how to live outside that box.</p>
